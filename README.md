# sys-pharm-22
Repository for code used in JHU EN.580.430 - Systems Pharmacology, Spring 2022

## `module1_pk`: Code for module 1 on pharmacokinetics and ODEs

To run these models, clone this repo and navigate in Matlab to the folder with your model of choice. Open the `*_main.m` file or the `*_driver.m` file and hit "Run". You do not need to run the `*_eqns.m` file - this will automatically be called, along with any other needed files in the same directory, when the main/driver file is run.
